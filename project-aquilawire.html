                        <h1>Aquilawire</h1>
                        <p>"Aquilawire" is a heavily modified Voxelab Aquila X2 converted to CoreXZ akin to the <a href="https://www.vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire">Voron Switchwire</a>.</p>
                        <p>It was bought for cheap on a black-friday sale and served me will with slight modification for many months. Until I discovered and fell into the world of Voron...</p>
                        <p>The switchwire provides linear rails, CoreXZ motion, kicking the Z screws to the curb, and saying goodbye to the hassle of dealing with z-wobble. It was like a laundry list of upgrades to boost speed, precision, and overall print quality.</p>
                        <p>I stumbled upon this gem of a project by <a href="https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW">boubounokefalos</a>. They took the Aquila X2/Ender 3 frame and basically turned it into a Switchwire cousin. I printed the necessary parts & tweaked a few in ABS. I had to get everything just right. That marked the beginning of a whole new chapter.</p>
                        <p>But, of course, the modding journey doesn't stop there. Automatic z-offset became the next big thing on my list. Needed a nozzle end-stop for that, and I wasn't about to wait around for parts to ship. I fired up the lathe and turned out the needed parts.</p>
                        <p>I then came across the Klicky probe by <a href="https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe">jlas1</a> - a game-changer. This little guy became the key to hassle-free bed-levelling and nozzle swaps. Whipped up some configuration files in Klipper for auto-offset calibration. Now, I can switch nozzles easily, no feeler gauge required.</p>
                        <p>Now this printer takes it all in stride. Cruising at 200mm/s² speeds with 10k acceleration - it's a beast. Prints PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU. Albiet with lots of testing to find the right printer settings for each material it's been a very enjoyable project with an awesome printer to use at the end.</p>

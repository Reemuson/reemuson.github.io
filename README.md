As someone who doesn't do much web development (more-so low level programming). This was an interesting exercise and has been a source of learning. This website is the main site for Ryan Dynamics, an industrial consultancy. This website is also coded soley in HTML and CSS, no Javascript. It's responsive and has quite a few interesting design choices. The codebase isn't something to behold, however, it functions quite well.

                        <h1>Built vs Bought?</h1>

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            Within the world of 3D printing, before the boom of i3 style printers from Prusa,
                            Creality & others and certainly before Bambu Labs' iPhone of 3D printers the X1C. People
                            designed and built their own printers.
                            <a href="https://www.reprap.org/wiki/RepRap" target="_blank">RepRap</a> was founded in 2005
                            and became a
                            noble effort to create and design a printer capable
                            of self-replication — Rep from replication, Rap from rapid prototyping — and ideally make it
                            out of easily sourced parts. These RepRap printers were certainly not pretty, but paved the
                            way for makers to obtain additive manufacturing for their workshop or home. Additive
                            manufacturing opens the door for
                            creating parts out of plastic that are typically unfeasible or impossible with normal modes
                            of manufacturing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While RepRap was chugging along, <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/" target="_blank">Josef
                                Průša</a> created the Prusa i3 printer. A bed-slinging
                            design with an aluminium frame that is straightforward to manufacture en masse. Prusa's
                            printers exploded in popularity and other companies began joining in on the new market.
                            Companies like Creality, Lulzbot, Ultimaker and others started selling readily assembled
                            printers to the masses and the 3D printing craze soared to new heights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then came along the <a href="https://vorondesign.com/" target="_blank">VORON</a> design
                            group and their CoreXY printers like the V1, V2, V0 and
                            Trident. They produced incredibly well engineered designs and documentation to back up the
                            building process, people were able to build very nice machines at home that are capable of
                            high quality, high speed operation. Which at the time could not be said for their retail
                            counterparts. Slowly, enthusiasts would flock to building VORON printers as well as other
                            design groups who provided their own spin on what a good 3D printer should be — <a
                                href="https://docs.vzbot.org/" target="_blank">Vzbot</a>, <a
                                href="https://www.printables.com/model/387431-rook-mk1-3d-printer"
                                target="_blank">Rook</a>,
                            <a href="https://docs.zerog.one/" target="_blank">ZeroG</a> and others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then <a href="https://bambulab.com/en-au/x1" target="_blank">Bambu Labs</a> stepped in with their new offering taking inspiration from the likes of
                            Apple to create a ready-to-use 3D printer with advanced features to remove the guess-work
                            out of learning correct operation of a 3D printer. You could buy an X1C and be up and
                            running within an hour of opening the box, that's hard to compare to say a VORON V2 where
                            assembly can take upwards of 20 hours alone excluding setup and calibration.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The question then needs to be asked …</h3>
                        <h3>Should you build, or buy your next 3D printer?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Choosing whether to build or buy your next 3D printer depends on your goals, preferences,
                            and level of involvement in the hobby. Building a printer from scratch offers a truely
                            unique
                            opportunity to familiarize yourself with every aspect of the machine. It's akin to the
                            enthusiast who enjoys tinkering with their car or electronics, gaining a deeper
                            understanding of how things work and learning a lot along the way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, it's important to recognize that not everyone has the time, resources, or
                            inclination to embark on a DIY printer project. Just as CNC machinists may not necessarily
                            build their own 5-axis machines, many individuals opt to purchase pre-assembled printers
                            from reputable brands. These ready-to-use printers offer convenience and relative
                            reliability,
                            sparing users the hassle of assembly and calibration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, one could choose to buy a Bambu Labs X1C or a Creality K1 and
                            use it as is, very much a turnkey solution. Alternatively, investing in a Prusa printer,
                            while not as feature-rich as some other models, offers a balance of reliability and
                            performance with the added benefit of being well-calibrated and user-friendly. Ultimately,
                            the decision between building and buying comes down to your individual preferences,
                            priorities, and level of involvement in the 3D printing community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, tomorrow's list of readily-obtainable 3D printers will be very different to
                            today's. While we have incredible machines like the X1C or even industrial offerings like
                            the <a href="https://visionminer.com/products/22idex" target="_blank">22 IDEX</a>. It's hard to say how much more advanced printers will become in the future. The
                            market has been disrupted and it's an arms race to create the next best machine. Design
                            groups like VORON and VzBot are too trying to keep up with open-source alternatives and I do
                            see them staying in this race a little while longer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether or not you build or buy the printer you use, learning how to operated it and obtain
                            maximum performance is the real skill. The future of manufacturing is 3D printing, while not
                            always producing 3D printed parts but even using them in other methods of manufacture as
                            well. Whether using 3D printed parts as fixtures in milling or turning, creating moulds from
                            printed parts or even other methods not yet invented.
